This log file starts with version 1.3. Prior changes are documented in the
main.c and the README.1.3 file.

Version 1.3a
------------
I changed the code so that it should be more compatible to the different
cc versions. Included an aix and osf rule into the Makefile.
No features were added

Version 1.3b
------------
Two small bugs were fixed: 
1) If the CLient is called with a sitename as parameter if now doesn't attempt
   to use the auto login sequence of site0 anymore. ;)
2) I accidently took out the
   LDFLAGS = -s
   line which caused the binary to remain unstripped

Version 1.3c
------------
Another attempt to make the code more compatibe - I changed some variable types
in function headers. I don't know why but now it compiles fine with IRIX's and
hopefully also BSD's cc compiler.
The user now gets a message when there's movement on another session than the 
active one.

Version 1.3d (silently released)
------------
Fixed some more bugs, mainly one that caused the CLient to consume a lot of
processor time and one that didn't reset the login macro if the connection
attempt failed.
<Backspace> at the end of an input line now doesn't re-print the whole line
every time anymore.
Hitting ^D at the BBS's login name prompt now closes the connection immediately
(inserted a fflush() there)

Version 1.3e (silently released)
------------
VMS fix: replaced all strchr()s and index() with mystrchr() and strrchr() and
rindex() with mystrrchr(). Other fixes to make the source more VMS-compatible.

Version 1.3f
------------
Made <Ctrl-V> work again (along with other CTRL codes).
Set the maximal line length for editor editing from 78 to 79 (which is the
correct value. ;)
Added an option to have colours switched on or off by default (SonCrest patch)
<Ctrl-C> can now be used to abort an attempt to start a new session (thanks to
MathFox for the idea of how to do it =).
The CLient now supports up to 36 BBSs (A-Z, 0-9).
BBS names or parts of it may be used as command line option to specify the BBS 
to connect to.
Made some patches to improve handling of OS-dependant code at compile time

Version 1.3g
------------
Removed the cprintf() routine for compatibility reasons. Sad but necessary.
I gave this version to some friends out, so I decided to give it an own version
identification. Not much new here, contains some unfinished things.

Version 1.3h
------------
The code compiles without any error messages now again on all systems I tested
it on: Linux, SunOS, HP-UX, Ultrix, Irix, OSF/1 and NeXT.
Removed a bug that caused the CLient to crash after multiple session switching
on some systems.

Version 1.3i
------------
some minor changes, mostly internal.
started implementing a scanner for ANSI escape color sequences to keep track
of the current color even if the BBS doesn't send ^A codes.
Peole on the CLient wholist can now be TAB-expanded at any time at a BBS
name prompt.
Added the -F option to allow to finger the BBS host. A username can be
specified right after the -F (without spaces, username spaces usually should
be replaced with '_'s.

Version 2.0
-----------
Finished DOC (ISCA) and ABC BBS client support
Added a connect prompt to handle the 36 slots (+ command line slot) and modes
(YAWC, DOC and telnet) properly. Standard key is <^B><^C> but it's
configurable.
Added <^B><+> and <^B><-> to scroll through the open sessions.
Added <^B><?> to show which sessions are open and where are data waiting to
be received.
Added <^B><c> to access the config menu without being connected to a BBS
Fixed a load problem, mostly on SunOS/Solaris systems - they reported that the
CLient would raise the system load by 1 (which it probably did not btw.)
Fixed incorrect scanning of a DOC <Ctrl-W> list on some systems
(hopefully) fixed ANSI color code scanning to keep track of current color
(hopefully) fixed the delete bug in the line input routine
Fixed the way ABORT and PING are handled when entering an x message
Fixed "too many files open" problem.
Started coding a new input routine but it's not finished yet. can be activated
by an option.
First official release since version 1.2e

Version 2.0 rev. A
------------------
Fixed some bugs: configuration option toggling, default key behaviour, \r-\n

Version 2.0 rev. B
------------------
Nicolas of Global Village BBS added support for multiple X

Version 2.0 rev. C
------------------
Nicolas of Global Village BBS added support for detecting BBS's that support
multiple X
