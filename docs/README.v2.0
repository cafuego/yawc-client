      how to do it. For a complete documentation see client.manual.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Changes compared to the previous version, PR-DWD 1.2E:
==========================================================

Features:
  - Auto login (username only or username and password)
    protecting of those passwords with a master password (DES encryption
    routines made by Eric Young [eay@mincom.oz.au], see des.h for details)
  - supports BBS comments (names) again, <c><c><l><b> changed a lot ;)
  - more command line options (use -? switch to get a list) e.g. BBS can now 
    be specified as 'yawc #', 'yawc -#' or 'yawc -s #' for max. compatibility
    also you can now specify a hostname without having to type '-h' first.
  - flexclient-like auto reply feature (<Ctrl-B><i>, <c><c><l><a>)
  - keyboard lock function <Ctrl-B><I>, can be combined with auto-reply =)
  - name scrolling (<Ctrl-N> / <Ctrl-K>)
  - colour and monochrome capturing now fully possible (YAWC)
  - CLient can now be used as ordinary telnet program ('-t' switch; e.g. in 
    case your BBS's yawcserver is down), and you can still use the local 
    editing features by activating them by hand
  - the CLient now supports a -i option to connect in ISCA client mode

  ...and don't forget to try the cursor keys (left/right) when entering 
  posts/X messages! ;) In case you missed that in the PR-DWD-1.2 version. =)

  See also the file client.manual for a complete CLient reference of all
  features not mentioned here.


Internal changes:
  - supports BBS feature negotiation for 
     * POST_MARK - allows killing of posts by ppl being on the CLients enemylist
     * TELOPT_LOGOUT - prevents being logged out prematurely while posting
    These options will come into action if your BBS supports them. =)
  - CLient now tries 3 times to connect until it gives up (non-VMS)
  - extended the state machine to be fully(?) telnet protocol compliant
  - I cleaned up the code a bit, removed unused variables and rewrote some 
    function headers for old-style compiler compatibility
  - Changed the Makefile to try cc if gcc cannot be found (will this work?)
  - The CLient is now also DOC and ABC client compatible

2. Description of the new features
===================================

 Auto login    <c><c><l><b>, <c><c><l><m>, 'yawc #'
----------------------------------------------------

This might look scary. It is not. ;)

This CLient version offers an auto login feature. This is done by storing
usernames and passwords in the .yawcbbsrc file and copying them to a macro
at login time and executing it. You can provide either only the username or
username and password. The latter enables a complete auto login but implies
that the password has to be in the CLient config file which is a potential
security risk. The first method will enter the username automatically and then
wait for you to enter the password manually.

Even though the CLient sets the .yawcbbsrc to owner-read/write-only at every
startup it is very insecure to have cleartext passwords in config file. 
Therefore the CLient offers you to encrypt the passwords before saving them. 
You can specify a 'master password' which you have to enter every time the
Client starts up to be able to access the encrypted passwords.

Login and password can be entered at the BBS prompt (<c><c><l><b>), see below
for that (BBS prompt extensions).

To change the master password type <c><c><l><m> at the short BBS prompt. If
you already set a master password you will have to enter it again (correctly ;)
before you can set a new one. Then enter the new password (twice) and all
passwords given now and in the future will be encrypted before saving them to
the config file.

If no correct master password has been given no encrypted passwords cannot be
decrypted and won't be changed. Unencrypted passwords can be changed however
and new ones can be set (if file permission allows it). So only encrypted
passwords are (relatively) safe against stealing/using.

If you just hit <Return> at the new password prompt the password will be
deleted so that you don't have to enter it anymore from the next CLient 
startup. But note that this will mean that your BBS passwords aren't encrypted
either if you specified any. So work without a master password ONLY if you

  * didn't store any passwords in the .yawcbbsrc  or
  * have a machine for your own where nobody has access to (and even here
    (it's unsafe).

The usernames will be saved in the .yawcbbsrc like
username# User Name
where # is the BBS slot number the name belongs to and User Name is the login
name for that BBS.

The passwords can be saved either as
password# user-pwd|
or
pwd_encr# HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The first version would contain an unencrypted password (terminated with a |),
the second specifies an encrypted password with H being hex digits (0-9,A-F).

The master password will be saved (encrypted of course ;) like
master_pw HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
at the beginning of the .yawcbbsrc, it looks like a pwd_encr line.

Don't try to switch sessions while the auto login is in progress, or the macro
playing function might decide to send the remaining keystrokes to the wrong
BBS.

-------------------------------  WARNING  ------------------------------------
There's (nearly) no encryption algorithm that has been _proven_ to be safe
against being cracked. Same goes for DES. I tried hard to provide a secure
means to protect your passwords but I cannot guarantee that I didn't make a 
mistake while implementing the routines, or that the routines itself have no
flaws in it. I made the implementation to the best of my knowledge. To
encrypt the passwords a loop calling the actual encryption routine is performed
100 times for each password and DES is known to be very safe. But be warned 
that your passwords _could_ be stolen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 BBS config Prompt extensions    <c><c><l><b>
----------------------------------------------

I've changed the BBS prompt (<c><c><l><b><number>) a bit. It now asks for
  * the hostname (as usual)
  * the BBS's name (BBS comment in early BBS CLients)
  * the username on that BBS and
  * the password there.

If you just hit <Return> at the hostname prompt you'll be asked if you want
to delete the data stored for the current slot. hit <y> to do so. if you hit
<n> you'll be asked if you want to abort (in case you hit the number key by
accident) and the slot will not be changed if you press <y>

If you hit just <Return> at the BBS name prompt the BBS name won't be changed.

If you hit just <Return> at the username or password prompt no username or 
password information won't be saved to the .yawcbbsrc file.


 Saving config changes    <c><c>< >
------------------------------------

you can now decide whether you want to save the changes you made in the CLient
config (<c><c>). If you're at the CLient config prompt:

<E>nemy list <F>riend list <K>eys <L>ocal <M>acros <O>ptions ->

then you can hit
  * <s>, <Space> or <Return> to save the config changed unconditionally
  * <Q> to discard the changes unconditionally and
  * <q> to be asked if the current configuration should be saved. 


 Command line options    'yawc -?'
-----------------------------------

Some more command line options have been added. To make it easier for people
who are used to other CLients there are now three ways to specify the
connecting site: 'yawc 2', 'yawc -2' and 'yawc -s2' will equally select the
BBS host of slot 2 to connect to.
Another simplification: you can omit the '-h' of '-h bbs.host.name' when
specifying a hostname - everything without a dash which is longer than two 
characters will be treated as hostname

The other new parameters are -t (see "Telnet mode" below), -l, -P, -n and -d.

'yawc -?' will list all options and also print an explanation what they mean.
For -P be sure that the 'ping' command can be found in your search path.

 Auto reply    <Ctrl-B><i>
---------------------------

One of the flexclient's goodies is the auto reply feature, so I added a similar
one here. It doesn't work the same way as in Flex's version but I chose the
same hotkey, <Ctrl-B><i>.

Like auto login the auto reply function bases on a macro. If you have set 
the CLient into auto reply mode the CLient will play this macro after every
IAC XMSG_E sequence (the BBS's X message end mark). it then sends a 'v' 
(X reply), a text saying that this is an automatic message and a user-specified
line (away message). 

If you didn't enter such a line yet as you press <Ctrl-B><i> the CLient
will ask for it, if t's there it will be used. To change an existing message
press <c><c><l><a>.

Since this function is a macro it wouldn't work while you're entering a post
or a name, so the CLient will refuse to go into away mode while you're there.

The away message won't be saved in the .yawcbbsrc file and will be asked anew
in every session.


 Keyboard locking    <Ctrl-B><I>
---------------------------------

Since you might want to leave the computer when you put the CLient into auto
reply function it seemed logical to me to have a keyboard lock function as
well. It's <Ctrl-B><Shift-I>. You _need_ to have entered a (valid) CLient
master password before because that is what you have to enter to unlock the
keyboard again.

When you hit <Ctrl-B><I> the CLient will ask you if you want to combine the
lock with the auto reply feature. If you hit <n> here only the lock function
will come into action and all incoming data will be displayed as usual.  If 
you hit <y> the procedure will be the same as described in the chapter above.

After that the CLient will wait for any key which will bring up the password
prompt. All functions, inclusively session switching or shelling out will be
disabled. Enter the CLient password at the prompt to get access to your BBS 
session again. To discourage password guessing the CLient waits one second 
before it accepts another try. During the time you enter the password the
auto reply feature won't work!


 Name scrolling    <Ctrl-N>, <Ctrl-K>
--------------------------------------

Another known feature I now added is the name scrolling. If you're on a 
username prompt you can now hit <Ctrl-N> and <Ctrl-K> which will give you
all usernames you saw last on a <w>holist name by name. It works similar to
the TAB key but ignores any given name parts. <Ctrl-N> moved down in the 
wholist, <Ctrl-K> moves up. Currently no special names (like "- New User -"
or "*Connecting*") are filtered out, that's something for the next release. ;)


 Colour capturing    <Ctrl-B><trl-X>
-------------------------------------

I also fixed another feature - the capturing. It does now properly copy posts,
wholists and X messages into your .yawcbbstmp file. When you hit the capture
key (usually <Ctrl-X>) then you'll be asked if the CLient should leave all
color codes in or if you want plain text capturing only, The CLient will then
save all incoming texts into the temp file until you hit the capture key
again or start posing. After that copy the .yawcbbstmp to a safe location
before continuing working with the CLient to prevent the tempfile to be over-
written.


 Telnet mode   'yawc -t'
-------------------------

While working on a special part of the CLient routines (the IAC state machine)
it came to my mind that it wouldn't be a big deal to extend it to be really
telnet compatible, so I did it. By adding the command line option '-t' (or
'-p 23' which does the same) the CLient will connect to the telnet port instead
of the YAWC CLient port. E.g. to connect to BBS #1 via telnet type 

  yawc -t 1

and that's it. =)
This very much defeats the idea of the CLient, since it now really acts as a
telnet program but it's handy when you just tried to connect to the CLient
server - just use the same line but append a '-t'.

Since the CLient doesn't get any control characters when to go into local
editing mode when on through the telnet poer (becuase the BBS doesn't even 
know it's a CLient connecting) the local editing facilities cannot activated
automatically. So I added a possibility to activate them manually. See 
following chapter.

 The manual mode switching (DOC hack)    <Ctrl-B><x>|<e>|<n>|<s>|<p>
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea to this came when I logged on at KaraNet BBS (a DOC-style BBS without
any client support except pure telnet) and thought 'would there be a way to
make the local editing features work here?'. When it was done I found that 
it's also useful when a YAWC BBS currently hasn't got CLient support, so it
might be of general interest.

I made it so that you can switch into 5 different local modes modes manually
by entering macro sequencies:

  Macro         Function
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Ctrl-B><x>   X input mode (7 lines, cursor left/right support
<Ctrl-B><e>   post entering mode. unlimited lines, save promt
<Ctrl-B><n>   entering a user name (capitalizing first letters of each word
<Ctrl-B><s>   entering one line of up to 80 characters
<Ctrl-B><p>   entering a shadowed password

These macros are ONLY available when using the telnet port (23), they won't
shadow any _real_ macros when connected as real YAWC-CLient. Hit these 
combinations when you're at the corresponding prompts. Examples:

...BBS login screen...
Login: <Ctrl-B><n>Your User Name<return>
        ^^^^^^  ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^
Password: <Ctrl-B><p>**********<return>
...        ^^^^^^  ^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^

eXpress message to: <Ctrl-B><n>Recipents Name<enter>
                     ^^^^^^  ^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^
><Ctrl-B><x>
  ^^^^^^  ^
bla bla bla - your text<return>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^
<return>
 ^^^^^^

(The parts underlines with '^'s is what you enter, the others are possible BBS
texts.)
Just play with it, it's not difficult once you get the hang of it. You can even
your local editor to write or upload a post this way, hit <Ctrl-B><e> after
you're in <e>dit mode on the BBS, then <return> on a blank line to get to the
save prompt and then <e>. hit <s> for save and <a> for abort, as usual.

You'll find all your texts echoed back by the BBS, this is because the BBS
doesn't know that it doesn't have to - a good chance for you to check if
everything is right. ;)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's about it I think. Just ask me (Flint) if you're stuck somewhere or found
bugs (which are quite likely since much of the stuff I added was written from
scratch and is not excessively tested yet (that's YOUR part ;).

  Enjoy - Sven, aka. Flint.
