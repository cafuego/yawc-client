This is a kind of private list where I collected everything I found interesting
to improve. I will probably not implement everything listed here, maybe others
do which will continue to working on the CLient after me.

Bugs:
deletion - fixed?
ISCA auto reply
SCO comp: 
>BTW try making tha last parameter in the socket call IPPROTO_TCP (defined in
><netinet/in.h>
>I thought it was __SCO...

Features to add / fix / improve:
 - finish the new input routine!
 - session encryption
 - improve idle detection when in editor (stat())
 - improve command line handling (enable to use e.g. -ntd instead of -n -t -d)
 - init auto macro
 - improved x author recognition routine
 - separate temp files for each session, option to remove them at logout
 - WinCLient-like config file (idea by DWD)? or maybe like XF86Config?

go to last active session after quitting the current one
save away message
ports into .yawcbbsrc
key for line re-print (editing mode)
start config menu if no .yawcbbsrc present
master pw change only
quit all key
