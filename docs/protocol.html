<h2>Chapter 0: introduction</h2>
</a>
Since nobody bothered to make a protocol description for DOC (ISCA) and YAWC
type BBS clients here's mine. It's re-engineered from the code so I can't
guarantee any correctness but promise to try to do this as accurate as
possible.
<p>
I'll start with a short introduction about the several clients, their
backgrounds and their basic differences as far as the protocol is concerned.
After that I'll describe what happens when a client tries to connect, when
it is connected and when the connection is being closed.
The last part will describe some extensions to the YAWC protocol and show 
how new features can be implemented without breaking older clients.

<h2>Chapter 1: The different types of clients</h2></a>
<h3>
<a name=1.1>
1.1. The DOC client</h3></a>

Apparently in 1993 Serendipity from ISCA BBS release the first client program
for a DOC style BBS. It was then developed until 1994 where it reached version
number 1.5 which nowadays is usually referred to "stock ISCA client".
Several other clients derived from it or were written after examining
Serendipity's code, for example IO ERROR's, TOM's
and others for Unix type systems, Roady&Dox's for MS Windows and others for
other systems as well.
<p>
DOC style BBSs that support special clients usually catch them at port 23 which
is also used for normal telnet connections. Once the connecting program is 
recognized as BBS client instead of a plain telnet client the BBS goes into
a special client mode which among other things will send certain control
sequencies to the client so it could act upon them in a semi-intelligent way.
<p>
Another type of BBSs that has been designed to be as compatible as possible 
to the DOC look and feel is the ABC code. It also supports DOC compatible
clients but listens for them on port 4123. this allows to run the BBS on a
host where the standard telnet daemon cannot be changed to an own daemon
which would log the user straight into the BBS and also recognizes BBS clients.
Apart from that all that will be said about DOC clients applies to ABC as well.

<h3>1.2. The YAWC CLient</h3></a>

In 1994 (or 1995?) Kenneth Haglund aka. KHaglund, author of the YAWC code, 
took Serendipity's client and made some changes on it to fit it to the needs
of a YAWC BBS. It lost some functionality (like friend and enemy lists) and got
some new ones (like multi session capability).
After him Peter Roozemaal aka. MathFox from Monolith BBS took over, he removed
some bugs, added improved color support and generally made the code run 
smoother a bit. After him Dave Cridland (Diamond White) made some improvements
including cursor support for the line input routine and finally after him I
made the most recent changes including making it compatible to DOC and ABC
again (without loosing YAWC CLient capabilities of course ;). MyLittlePonyTail
wrote a client for MS Windows. Some other people like Flex Able and the 
programmers at SonCrest did some client coding as well.
For some odd reasons the YAWC BBS client is often referred to as CLient and
the CLient derived from MathFox/Diamond White/myself was called CLientPro as
of version 1.3.
<p>
CLients usually connect to port 1976 instead of 23. this makes it easier to
install the BBS with only a minimum of root admin involvement. At the moemnt
KHaglund is working on using port 23 for CLients again so the latest code might
require that again finally.

<h2>Chapter 2: Connecting</h2>

<a name=2.1>
<h3>2.1. DOC</h3></a>

As mentioned earlier the DOC client connects to the standard telnet port, 23
usually. this means that it'll need to recognize telnet negotiation stuff as
described in the basic telnet RFC. Mainly this byte will be sequences like
IAC WILL|WONT|DO|DONT option
where IAC is 0xff(255), WILL,WONT,DO and DONT are 0xfe to 0xfb (254-251) and
option is a telnet option, also as described in several RFCs. For other values
see the end of this chapter below.
<p>
The client _should_ respond to these negotiation with a corresponding answer
(it should answer a IAC DO option with a IAC WONT option and to a 
IAC WILL option with a IAC DONT option), but most DOC clients just ignore 
the negotiation sequences completely. ISCA seems to work okay with that but
normal telnet daemons won't. The CLientPro will do the responses, as do
other DOC clients that also support telnet mode.
<p>
Before this all starts the client sends some bytes on it's own. The sequence
looks as follows: 
IAC, CLIENT2, IAC, SB, TELOPT_ENVIRON, 0, 1, "USER", 0, &lt;user&gt;, IAC, SE
This will identify the program as client compatible to v1.5 and pass the user
name as stored in the environment variable USER to the BBS.
<p>
After that the terminal size should be send in the NAWS format:<br>
<code>IAC, SB, TELOPT_NAWS, 0, 0, 0, rows, IAC, SE</code>.<br>

If that is sent the client will process the telnet IACs as described above.

Finally the BBS will send a IAC START which the client has to answer with a 
IAC START3 to identify itself as DOC client compatible to version 1.5 earlier 
clients would send IAC START or IAC START2 but those will be rejected by the 
BBS for being too old. All those values are also to be found in the telnet.h 
file of any client source.

After the client received a IAC START it also sets it's synchronization byte
to 0. This and it's function will be explained in chapter 2.3.

After that the BBS will send the login screen and then the login prompt. It
will then send IAC codes to get username and password, this will be described
in chapter 3.
<p>
The ABC code _always_ sends this sequence first:
<br><code>
IAC DO 0x24   IAC DO 0x1  IAC DO 0x1F  IAC DO 0x2C<br>
IAC WILL 0x3  IAC WILL 0x1  IAC DO 0x2E
</code><br>
and it _always_ expects a IAC CLIENT2 as first bytes to be sent by the client
or it will just hang!

<h3>2.2. YAWC</h3></a>

YAWC's CLient connections usually go to port 1976. Usually there's no telnet
daemon sitting at that port so the CLient wouldn't need to worry about telnet
IAC sequences. But since it's derived from the ISCA client it usually still
has the code in it that ignores those codes. Some clients however are well
capable to deal with them properly.
<p>
Right after connecting the BBS expects a IAC CLIENT to be sent by the CLient.
After that a NAWS sequence like this:
IAC, SB, TELOPT_NAWS, 0, 0, 0, rows, IAC, SE
should be sent to the BBS. Older YAWCs won't require that (but accept it
silently), but younger YAWC BBS versions will hang until you hit a key if
they don't get that sequence.
<p>
That's it. Now also the YAWC BBS will send IAC START to do the synchronizazion
stuff and the login screen and then will ask the user for username and 
password.

<h3>2.3. Synchronization</h3></a>

To avoid problems that can be caused by net lag and bad modem lines a simple 
but efficient synchronization method has been implemented into the BBS client;
it works the same way for both DOC and YAWC clients.
<p>
Both the BBS and the client have a sync variable which holds the current idea
of the BBS and the client about how many bytes have been sent by the client to
the BBS. it's an 4 byte although only the lower 3 of them are used. 3 bytes
provide a number &gt; 16 million, so someone would need to transfer more than
16 MB of data to the BBS in one session which should be highly unlikely.
<p>
(on the other hand if someone would manage to do so then he'll be in trouble
anyway because the sync bytes can't be syncronized anymore. and he'll probably
also have a lot of BBS admins running and shouting after him too ;)
<p>
At some time during the login procedure the BBS will send a IAC START 
sequence. This causes the client to set it's sync value to 0. The BBS does the
same right after sending that sequence.
Now with each byte the client sends and the BBS receives both ends increment
their couters _EXCEPT_ the data sent are IAC sequencies. They are just sent
but not counted.
<p>
The check if both synchronization bytes (BBS and client) are still identical is
done every time the BBS sends an input request that will cause the client to
enter a local mode. The next chapter does a further description about that.
<p>
To be able to correct some possible sync problems the BBS holds a buffer of
a certain amount of the most recent data bytes that have been sent. most
clients use 1 kB (1024 bytes) for that.
<p>
After the request for the client to go into such a local input mode the BBS
sends it's idea of the current sync value which the client then compares with
it's own value. Depending of the result the client does the following:
<ul>
  <li> if both values are identical - fine, no further action. 
  <li> if the BBS's value is too low the missing (client_sync-BBS_sync) bytes
    are re-sent to the BBS if the difference is lower than the size of the 
    sync buffer. (some clients will show a warning about that, other just
    resent the data silently). Some clients however will just set the BBS's
    sync value to their own counterpart and not re-send the data.
    A warning will be printed if the amount of missing bytes is larger than
    the buffer size.
  <li> If the BBS's value is bigger than the client's (hence the BBS thinks more
    bytes have been sent than the client thinks it has sent) then something has
    gone pretty wrong. The only thing the client can do is printing a warning
    about it and re-sync itselt with the BBS's value.
</ul>
The sync value the BBS sends is formatted low-high so the the actual value is
<code>byte1 + 256*byte2 + 65536*byte3</code>. (bytes 1-3 are ordered as received).

<h2>Chapter 3: Local modes (YAWC and DOC)</h2></a>
<a name=3.1>
<h3>3.1. Basics</h3></a>

Both DOC and YAWC have the same basic mechanism to let the clients know when
to do something locally. they differ in some details though.
<p>
One of the big advantagdes of having a BBS client instead of plain telnet is
the client's ability to do some stuff on it's side without bothering the BBS.
This cuts network load, lag and BBS machine load as well.
<p>
In order to do so the BBS needs to tell the client when to go into such a local
input mode and what to do and how to do it. This is done by using IAC 
sequencies again. These sequencies look like this:
<p><code>
IAC &lt;what_to_do&gt; &lt;option&gt; &lt;sync_low&gt; &lt;sync_med&gt; &lt;sync_high&gt;
</code><p>
After sending these bytes the BBS goes into a waiting position ignoring every
data from the client until the client sends a IAC BLOCK to tell the BBS that
it is now ready to transmit the results of the input. This technique solves 
some problems that arise from net lag and any data that might be on it's way 
back to the BBS while the BBS already sent the client into local mode.
<p>
The client should NOT send IAC BLOCK if it should do client configutation 
(G_CONFIG).
<p>
After sending IAC BLOCK and the data that has been read from the user the
client needs to let the BBS know that it's done with sending for now. the way 
the client lets the BBS know this depends on which routine has been called,
see the subsequent chapters.

<h3>3.2. Getting names</h3></a>

To read a user name the BBS sends this sequence:
<p><code>
IAC G_NAME &lt;quit_priv&gt;  &lt;sync_low&gt; &lt;sync_med&gt; &lt;sync_high&gt;
</code><p>
quit_priv can have the following values:
<ul>
  <li> 1: user can use &lt;Ctrl-D&gt; to quit (used at login time)
  <li> 2: get username (max. 20 characters, alow numbers as well)
  <li> 3: get room name (up to 40 characters)
  <li> 4: same as 2, originally used to indicate TAB support
  <li> 5: get user name (80 characters, allow "@". ".","_" and "-" too for email
       address and remote BBS system, also allow numbers to profile by them)
  <li> 6: same as 2, allow comma for multiple-x and multiple-mail support
       (comma end the string to detect that input end with comma)
</ul>
Only 1 to 3 are defined in the DOC protocol, and only newer YAWCs will use
the last two, it's a rather quick and dirty hack that had been implemented 
before the feature negotiation (see last chapter) had been developed. YAWC 
clients should use quit_priv = 2 if they receive a quit_priv &gt; 3 and don't 
know what to do with it.
<p>
It returns the name and appends a newline (\n) character to mark the end of 
the name.

<h3>3.3. Getting lines</h3></a>

To read a single line the BBS sends this sequence:
<p><code>
IAC G_STR &lt;length&gt;  &lt;sync_low&gt; &lt;sync_med&gt; &lt;sync_high&gt;  -or-<br>
IAC G_STRWR &lt;length&gt;  &lt;sync_low&gt; &lt;sync_med&gt; &lt;sync_high&gt;  (YAWC-only)<br>
</code>
<p>
After the client has received that command it will read a line of &lt;length&gt; 
characters locally. if the length is negative then the absolute amount of the
value will be taken for the maximum length of the input and the entered 
characters won't be printed on the screen but replaced by "*"'s (shadowed)
so that this is used for getting passwords.
<p>
Like G_NAME the client will send a \n character to mark the end of the line.
<p>
The described behaviour applies to G_STR. G_STRWR (a YAWC-only feature) will
nearly act the same way but will "wrap" the last word into a buffer. This means
that if the user enters a line and the line limit is reached the last word will
be removed again (except the last chacter was a space character) and stored
in a buffer. now if G_STRWR is called anew the wrapped word is being placed
on the start of the new line.
<p><i>
Note: The code for G_STRWR is 0xa6, the same that DOC uses for S_WHO. Don't
mix that. Also, YAWC's WHO_S code (183) is not the same as DOC's S_WHO.

<h3>3.4. Getting posts</h3></a>

To get a post the BBS sends this sequence:
<p><code>
IAC G_POST &lt;upload&gt;  &lt;sync_low&gt; &lt;sync_med&gt; &lt;sync_high&gt;
</code><p>
upload can have th following values:
<ul>
  <li> 1: normal message input
  <li> 2: post upload, end with &lt;ctrl-D&gt;
  <li> 3: editor-edit
</ul>
upload option 3 (editor-edit) is a YAWC-only feature. It will start the editor
right at the beginning for entering the post.
<p>
After finishing the post the client sends back to the BBS
<ul>
 <li> an IAC BLOCK
 <li> the post _if_ the user didn't abort posting
 <li> a &lt;Ctrl-D&gt; character and
 <li> an 'a' or 's' character depending of the user's action (abort or save).
</ul>
The BBS will only accept a maximum amount of 47800 bytes per post.

<h3>3.5. Getting X messages and profiles</h3></a>

To get a post the BBS sends this sequence:
<p><code>
IAC G_LINES &lt;which&gt; &lt;sync_low&gt; &lt;sync_med&gt; &lt;sync_high&gt;
</code><p>
On YAWC BBSs &lt;which&gt; can have the following values:
<ul>
  <li> 1 means express message,
  <li> 2 means profile.
</ul>
it _seems_ that DOC BBSs use these values:
<ul>
  <li> 0 means profile
  <li> !=0 means x message
</ul>
There are optional flags defined to better control the behaviour of the client
when entering an express message. Most of them aren't used anymore, but here
are they:
<ul>
 <li>which = 2: OVERRIDE usage enabled (OVERRIDE will deliver messages even to
   people who wouldn't receive messages immediately at that time
 <li>which = 4: BEEP usage enabled (probably just sends a beep to the recipient?)
 <li>which = 8: LOCAL usage enabled (LOCAL can be used by sysops+ to send 
  broadcasts to locally logged on users)
</ul>
<p>
It seems to be safe to assume that (which &amp; 1) == 1 means "x message" and
(which &amp; 1) == 0) means "profile".
<p>
On DOC BBSs the which value is a series OR'd bits to allow or disable
certain X overrides but I have been assured that most of them are obsolete. So
it seems that relying on the values 1 and 2 will be sufficient.
<p>
Another difference between DOC and YAWC is how lines are handled. DOC _always_
only accepts 5 lines for both X messages and profiles. YAWC's limitations are
more flexible:
<ul>
  <li> profiles: up to 10 lines and up to 5*79 characters (if one of these limits
    is reached no more characters will be accepted) and
  <li> x messages: up to 20 lines and up to 7*79 characters (same)
</ul>
After the data have been entered an IAC BLOCK will be sent and then the data.
To mark the end of the data block a \n character is send afterwards _and_
YAWC BBSs need an additional \0 byte after that except an "ABORT" is sent to
indicate to the BBS that the user aborted his message and the message is an
express message.

<h3>3.6. Client configuration</h3></a>

To cause the client to do client configuration the BBS sends this sequence:
<p><code>
IAC G_CONFIG &lt;option&gt; &lt;sync_low&gt; &lt;sync_med&gt; &lt;sync_high&gt;
</code><p>
&lt;option&gt; will be ignored.<p>
After finishing the client just sends a newline (\n) back to the BBS to
indicate that it finished configuring. Note that _no_ IAC BLOCK is sent
although at least YAWC BBSs will usually accept (and ignore) IAC BLOCK here.

To allow a client to edit a file (for example a roominfo locally on the
client side this sequence will be sent:
<code><p>
IAC FILE_S &lt;file contents&gt; IAC FILE_E<br>

</code><p>
The client will read &lt;file contents&gt; into a temp file and upon EDIT_S it will
start the editor to allow the user to edit the uploaded data.
<p>
After finishing the client sends IAC BLOCK back, then sends the file contents
(which mustn't contain NULL (\0) bytes and appends a \0 to mark the end of
the file.

Only up to 47800 bytes are accepted by the BBS.

<h2>4.   Online userlist handling</h2></a>
<a name=4.1>
<h3>4.1. Basics</h3></a>

The client is able to download a online user list from a DOC or YAWC BBS.
This can be used for several purposes like displaying friends (and enemies)
complared to local lists, for TAB name expansion and so on.
<p>
DOC and YAWC differ a lot at this point. This is mainly because KHaglund
understood the way the client processes wholists differently than it was
intended.

<p><hr><p>
<a name=4.2>
<h3>4.2. DOC</h3></a>

The main purpose of the online user list download is to compare the names with
friends listed in the .(yawc)bbsrc file to be able to spot them.
Some clients already offer TAB expansion of usernames in the friend list, the
CLientPro also supports to expand _any_ name after calling a &lt;ctrl-w&gt; list.
after the client sends a &lt;ctrl-W&gt; to the server the BBS answers with an IAC
S_WHO and then a series of one-byte flags and null-terminated user names.
<p>
The flags mean:
<ul>
 <li> 0x80: "User has switched off the express messages"
 <li> any other value: "User is able to receive x messages".
</ul>
After the last name is transmitted another single \0 byte is sent to the
client to tell it that the wholist transfer is finished.
<p>
<i>Note: The code for S_WHO is 0xa6, the same that YAWC uses for G_STRWR. Don't
mix that. Also, YAWC's WHO_S code (183) is not the same as DOC's S_WHO.</i>

<h3>4.3. YAWC</h3></a>

YAWC's approach is very different. The main purpose here is to fill a TAB list
so that the user should be able to do TAB name expansion for all users online
at that time after reading a wholist. Since many YAWC BBSs have their internal
friendlists that function of the CLient had been deacticated for a long time.
(I finally partly reactivated them to allow the user to always expand friend's
names even before pulling a wholist and also after that.)
<p>
YAWC doesn't have just a name transferring feature as DOC uses when the user
hits &lt;Ctrl-W&gt; to see who of his friends is there. Instead the real &lt;w&gt;holist
(usually the long version) is used. This means the user _has_ to hit &lt;w&gt; once
to be able to TAB expand any online user names.
<p>
The BBS will tell the CLient that a wholist is to follow now by sending IAC
WHO_S.
<p>
The name marking in the wholist lines has changed with time so there are now
two possibilities. right before the username there can either be a
  - &lt;Ctrl-D&gt; or a
  - \r (carriage return)
to mark the beginning of the name. The end of the name is determined as
follows: The CLient will scan 20 characrers starting after &lt;ctrl-D&gt; and &lt;\r&gt;
and then remove all trailing spaces. So the BBS _has_ to transmit at least
((username length) - 20) spaces after the user name. After that the rest of
the wholist line will follow.
After the last wholist line has been transmitted the BBS will send IAC WHO_E.

<h2>5.   Other BBS-client communication (YAWC and DOC)</h2></a>
<a name=5.1>
<h3>5.1. eXpress message marking</h3></a>

DOC and YAWC BBSs let the clients know when an X message is being transmitted.
This may be used to filter out unwanted messages by having the names of the
senders on the client's enemy list. YAWC doesn't make much use of it but the
'x killing' feature now works again since the latest version of the CLientPro.
<p>
The format is pretty simple: the BBS will send an IAC XMSG_S right before
transmitting header and body of the x message and IAC XMSG_E right after it.
no reaction from the client is expected by the BBS.

<h3>5.2. Post marking</h3></a>

DOC BBSs mark the transmitted posts similar to the express messages as 
described in the previous chapter. The reason also is to allow the client to
do some filter function.
<p>
The protocol is only slightly more complicated than that one for x messages:
the BBS sends a IAC POST_S before and IAC POST_E after the post. The client
notifies the BBS if it kills a post. for that every received post is counted
(starting value set by IAC START is 1) and the lowest byte of that number
(numposts&0xff) is being sent back to let the BBS know which post has been
killed. This is to tell the BBS that if it's on a -more- prompt of a killed post
it should abort the post transfer and not wait for key strokes for the -more-
prompt. The whole sequence is
<p><code>
IAC POST_K (numposts&0xff) 17.
</code><p>
Most YAWC BBSs don't send the IAC POST_S and IAC POST_E seqeuncies so the 
CLient can't kill posts. The CLientPro is however prepared for that so that
as soon as those IACs will be implemented into the BBS that feature will
also work for them (some YAWCs already did so). 
<p>
The CLient should _not_ send the killing notification to a YAWC BBS, it 
doesn't expect one and will most likely act weird if it receives one.
<p>
YAWC BBSs should _only_ send POST_S and POST_E after that's negotiated with the
CLient to not break older CLients - see chapter 7 for details.

<h3>5.3. -More- prompt marking</h3></a>

To allow the client to capture posts and other data but excluding any --more--
prompts that may turn up they are enclosed by IAC MORE_M bytes. This is true
for both DOC and YAWC. The BBS doesn't expect any special answer by the client.

<h3>5.4. Idle / cutoff detection</h3></a>

DOC BBSs send a IAC CLIENT sequency to the client every 10 minutes to see if
the client is still connected the client should response with a IAC CLIENT too.
<p>
YAWC BBSs don't have a standard way to detect cutoffs, no IAC CLIENTs are
sent usually. Thanatos once made an attempt to detect if the client is idle
by sending IAC CLIENT and the CLient would only respond if the user wasn't 
idle for more than 6 minutes but this hasn't be used anywhere else, especially
since this way of doing it wasn't very pretty. Another way has been found, see
chapter 7 to find out more about that.

<h3>5.5. Color config update (YAWC only)</h3><7a>

This is a YAWC addition to the DOC client protocol. it's to tell the client
if it should show colors at all and if so if bold and/or flashing attributes
should be allowed or not. This way after the user changed the corresponding 
BBS setting the BBS can immediately tell the CLient about it so the client
can use that change right after the user changed those configuration. The 
format is this:
<p><code>
IAC CONFIG US_ANSICOLORS US_NOFLASH US_NOBOLDCOLORS
</code><p>
If US_ANSICOLORS is 1 the client will show colors, if 0 it won't. This will
only filter out YAWC colors (see next chapter), not ANSI ESCAPE sequencies.
If US_NOFLASH is 1 flashing will be disabled, enabled if 0.
If US_NOBOLDCOLORS is 1 bold colors will be disabled, enabled if 0.
<p>
YAWC doesn't expect any answer of this from the CLient.

<a name=5.6>
<h3>5.6. DOC and YAWC colors</h3></a>

Some DOC BBSs implemented a feature to allow users to use own colors at some
places like doings and posts. The color notation is a two character sequency.
The first is a '@', the second is usually the first letter of the desired
color. upper case letters indicate foreground colors and lowercase letter
background colors. to actually print a '@' two @'s ('@@') have to be used.
For a complete listing of those codes see appendix A.
<p>
This is only remotely interesting from the client perspective because the BBS
generates the ANSI color code and sends it to the client. YAWC BBSs however
usually sent the YAWC color code to the CLient and that client then transforms
that into a color. that's why the CLient can switch on and off colors itself.
The YAWC color sequency looks as follows: the first character is a &lt;Ctrl-A&gt;.
after that the color code follows, as well usually the first letter of the
color. Unlike DOC the _lowercase_ letters change the foreground colors and the
_uppercase_ letters change the background. Also see appendix A for details.

<h3>5.7. Terminal size change</h3></a>

If the BBS client's terminal is being resized the terminal should generate a
SIGWINCH signal which is catched by the clients which then send a NAWS
sequency to the BBS to tell it about the size change. This NAWS code complies
to RFC 1073. This is what is sent:
<p><code>
IAC SB TELOPT_NAWS 0 0 0 &lt;rows&gt; IAC SE
</code><p>
row is the current (new) number of rows the terminal has.
<p>
So it's the same code that is also sent at connecting time by the client. The
BBS shouldn't answer to this message except changing the screen size setting
for the user.

<h3>5.8. YAWC name marking</h3></a>

To be able to fill the CLient user's TAB list even if no &lt;w&gt; is pressed
every time the CLientPro supports name marking. Fake YAWC color codes are
used for that: Right before a username a &lt;Ctrl-A&gt;&lt;n&gt; is sent and a &lt;Ctrl-A&gt;&lt;N&gt;
right after it. The text between them is considered a username by the CLient
and added to the TAB list. If names in post headers and X message headers
this enables to TAb expand the names of users that just sent messages to the
recipient and who posted messages.
This is a later extension of the YAWC protocol, only few BBSs support it but
it won't break older CLients in any case.

There's no real standard logout negotiation. If either side closes the sockets 
so that the other side will get an error reading or writing that side will 
just close the session as well.

However newer YAWC CLients will send a IAC DO TELOPT_LOGOUT seqeuncy to the
BBS right before closing the connection, as specified in RFC 727. This might 
give the BBS the chance to close the connection properly but after Thantos BBS
went down I don't think any BBS makes use of that at the moment.

<h2>7.   YAWC protocol extentions</h2></a>
<a name=7.1>
<h3>7.1. Basics</h3></a>

To make it possible to extend the YAWC CLient protocol without breaking older
clients a feature negotiation has been developed. It goes as follows:
The BBS sends a IAC DO CLIENT_OPTIONS to the client. old clients will just
ignore this, negotiation-aware ones will respond with IAC WILL CLIENT_OPTIONS.
The BBS can then go on asking the CLient to enable (or disable) certain 
extentions by issuing 
IAC SB CLIENT_OPTIONS &lt;feature&gt; ON|OFF
where feature is the item of negotiation and ON means "enable the feature" and
OFF means "disable feature".
<p>
The CLient should now decide it the requested extention is implemented and can
be processed and it responds with
IAC SB CLIENT_OPTIONS &lt;feature&gt; OK|ERROR
where OK means that the client is ready to support the feature and ERROR that
it is not. The BBS should not enable that feature in that case.
<p><i>
Note: You might notice that the usual IAC SE is missing that would be
necessary according to the telnet RFCs. we just omit it because we do know
exactly how many bytes are sent after the IAC SB CLIENT_OPTION sequency: 2.</i>

<p><hr><p>
<a name=7.2><h3>7.2. Implemented extentions</h3></a>

These extentions are in use at some places right now:
<ul>
 <li> POST_MARK: send IAC POST_S and POST_E around posts.
     Older clients will fail to properly handle IAC POST_S and POST_E properly
     so it has to be made sure those codes will only be sent to a CLient that
     really knows about them and can use them for the enemy post killing.
  <li> TELOPT_LOGOUT: determine CLient idling
     If this feature is enabled then the BBS will send a IAC WILL TELOPT_LOGOUT
     one minute before it intends the CLient to boot (because the BBS thinks
     the CLient user is idling. But the user might be in local editing mode
     so it would be a bad idea to close the user's connection at that time.
     Therefore when the CLient receives that code and knows that the user is
     indeed active entering a message it'll answer with IAC DONT TELOPT_LOGOUT
     and the BBS should set the user's idle time to 0 again.
     (This feature can of course easily abused by modified clients to be logged
     on forever, so the BBS should have a max time for only receiving those
     TELOPT_LOGOUT signals and still boot the user after some time if he
     doesn't show more activity.

  Both prepare to release v2.15 Final. (still in progress)

<h3>YAWC unix clients:</h3></a>
<ul>
<li><b>KHaglund</b> took the DOC and modified it so it would connect to YAWC BBSs.
  Unlike the DOC client it supports multiple open connections at a time
<li><b>MathFox</b> fixed some bugs and improved the color handling, his (popular)
  version was called PRclient
<li><b>Flex Able</b> also made an own version of the client including Ctrl-N name
rotating but it wasn't widely used.
<li>Another version had been released by the coders of <b>SonCrest BBS</b>. I'm not
exactly sure what they changed or added except a perl script to convert ANSI
color codes into YAWC colors in the CLient's temp file.
<li><b>Diamond White</b> added further extensions to the PRclient including a new
getline routine that supports (limited) cursor support and other line editing
functions. his version was the PR-DWD CLient.
<li><b>Flint</b> (me) removed some bugs from the PR-DWD version and extended and
added new features, like increasing the number of BBS slots and finally
making the CLient compatible to DOC BBSs again. That CLient first was called
PR-DWD-F but the name changed to CLientPro later.
